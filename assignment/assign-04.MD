Follow the steps in the tutorial and write a Tensorflow program using your cloud ML instance.  
  
Questions:
a) 
-  What's the best accuracy you get on the test dataset?  
-  What's the optimum value of the numEpochs and the learningRate.  
-  Plot the error with Matplotlib 

b)
- add new neural network layyers and training the model again. comapre the error function between these two models.
